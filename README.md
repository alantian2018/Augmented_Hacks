# Climap 
***
### What is Climap?
Climap is an online interactive visualizer.
<br/>
Current trends indicate a rise in both global temperatures and pollution within the next couple of decades.
***
### User Guide
Because much of this is thought to be caused by human activities, we have overlayed human population density on top of the map. Simply click on a region to discover the predicted impacts of climate change.
<br/>
[You can try it out on our website!](https://pollution.theglobaltech.org/)

### Methodologies
In order to predict the effect climate change on various countries and regions around the world, we have developed a model using LSTM machine learning algorithms to predict future average temperature. We plan add more features in the future, and to also scale this to specific cities.
